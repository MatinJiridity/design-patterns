/**
 * Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.
 * The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and 
 * transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.
 * Identification: Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of a different abstract/interface type. 
 * When the adapter receives a call to any of its methods, it translates parameters to the appropriate format and 
 * then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.
